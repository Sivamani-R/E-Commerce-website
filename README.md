# E-Commerce-website
Welcome to my first-ever web development project â€” a fully functional E-Commerce Website built from scratch! This project helped me explore and implement core concepts of frontend and backend development, routing, user interaction, and basic cart functionality.
## Project Overview
This E-Commerce site simulates an online shopping platform where users can:
1.)Browse products
2.)View product details
3.)Add items to the cart
4.)Checkout
